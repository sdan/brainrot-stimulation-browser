  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: December 27, 2024</p>

  <p>
    Thank you for choosing to use <strong>Brainrot Stimulation for ChatGPT</strong>. 
    Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes how this extension 
    (“we,” “our,” or “us”) handles any data it processes.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Scope</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Brainrot Stimulation for ChatGPT</strong>
    browser extension (the “Extension”). It does not apply to any external websites, 
    services, or platforms (e.g., YouTube) that this Extension may load or link to. 
    Your use of third-party services is governed by their respective privacy policies 
    and terms.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> The Extension does not collect, store,
      or transmit any personal information or personally identifiable data. It merely
      injects video iframes for display alongside the ChatGPT interface.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Permissions:</strong> We use the <code>activeTab</code> permission to inject 
      overlay content into supported websites. This permission does not give us access 
      to your browsing history or personal data. The Extension only activates when you 
      visit the domains specified in the Extension’s manifest file.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>External Content:</strong> The Extension loads video embeds from YouTube and 
      other external hosts. Please note that using such external services is subject to 
      their own privacy policies and terms of service; we do not control or receive any 
      personal data from these external hosts.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    Since we do not collect user data, we do not share, sell, or disclose your personal 
    information with any third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect or store user data on our servers. Any interactions with external 
    sites (e.g., YouTube) occur over secure connections as provided by those platforms. 
    We recommend that you always maintain good security practices, including keeping 
    your browser and operating system up to date.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This Extension is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly 
    collect any personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our 
    practices, technologies, legal requirements, or other factors. Any updates will be 
    posted here with an updated “Last updated” date. We encourage you to review this 
    policy periodically.
  </p>
